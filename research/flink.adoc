== Introduction

Apache Flink is a distributed platform for batch and streaming processing.
The core of Flink is the streaming engine which makes the processing. All APIs
and libraries are build on top of the engine. The image <<#img-flink-components>>
shows the architecture of Flink. Flink was developed by the TU Berlin in 2004
and is now an Apache Project. Flink itself is developed in Java. That means a
developer can write a flink application in Java, but on can
write an application in Scala, because Flink has a Scala API, too, which is a
wrapper of the Java API. The current version is 1.5.0.

The base concepts of Flink are streams and transformation operations on streams.
A stream is an un bounded list of data records. A transformation operation takes
one or more input streams, make some operations on them and write the results
back to on ore more output streams. The image <<#img-flink-overview>> shows the
flow of Flink. Because the processing engine is for streams all batch data are
handled internally as streams. This transformation works because a batch data is
a bounded stream. But it is important that on know the two different views,
because operations are works different. Let see an example
for that. The use of aggregating functions makes in streaming no sense, because
you never know how much elemens was in the stream. If you want so solve this
problem you need the help of windows that means you store all the incomming data
between a time frame and then for this time frame the aggregating functions will
work.

== Application Development

Apache Flink contains two data abstractions one for every programming model.
The DataSet are for batch-programming and the DataStream are for
stream-programming. These are for low level programming. The API which are built
on top of these abstractions are for high level programming. Flink provides the
following high level API:

* Batch-Processing
[horizontal]
Flink-ML:: Machine-Learning
Gelly:: Graph-Processing
Table-API & SQL:: Database-Processing
* Stream-Processing
[horizontal]
CEP:: Event-Processing
Gelly-Streams:: Graph-Processing(experimental)
Table-API & SQL:: Database-Processing
