= Masterthesis: Evaluation aktueller Bibliotheken f√ºr Stream Graph Processing

What means graph stream processing. A stream is like an assembly line.
A the start someone put the packages, at the end someone take the packages and
in the middle someone make some operations on the package. A graph means in this
context a dependency graph or a social-network graph. There a lots of algorithm
that can be used with graphs but they work all on the hole graph. This is only
practical for small or medium size graphs. Stream Graph Processing combines
both worlds streaming and grpah processing. That means you get at realtime a
sub graph or an change event for the processing. The goal is to answer questions
of the sub graph and make with that information a backtracking of the hole graph.
