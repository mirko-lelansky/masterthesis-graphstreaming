= examples

This are the different examples for the different libraries. For more information
about the concrete example look at the specific README.

== Modules

The module "bipartite-gelly" contains the bipartite check for the gelly-streaming
library. This example is already implemented in the library and in our reference
for the other implementation.

The module "bipartite-graphstreamproject" contains the bipartite check for the
graphstreamproject library.

The module "flink-gelly-streaming" contains the fork of the library
"gelly-streaming". This fork adds only a gradle build file to work with the
gradle infrastructure. This can be removed if the library is available over a
public maven repository.
